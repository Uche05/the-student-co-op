## Why This Exists
Universities teach students to pass exams, but workplaces demand more than knowledge, they demand behavioural readiness. Many graduates struggle with communication, confidence, leadership, or collaboration because career platforms focus on credentials, not fit. These gaps aren’t about intelligence; they’re about alignment, often invisible until real-world experience exposes them, a problem known as employment-blindness.

## What Student Co-op Does Differently
Student Co-op is an awareness-driven platform that helps students understand how their personal traits align with their target careers. It reframes career preparation as a self-awareness challenge.
Instead of asking, “What career are you interested in?” it asks,“Are you developing the traits required to succeed in that career?” The system then turns personality and behavioural data into a clear development roadmap.

## How it Works
### - Psychometric Onboarding
Students complete an awareness-based assessment that measures behavioural traits relevant to professional success. These traits are mapped across key dimensions such as communication, leadership, analytical thinking, adaptability, and resilience.
### - Industry Benchmark Mapping
Each career path has associated behavioural benchmarks. The student’s profile is compared against these benchmarks and visualised through a Radar Map. This visual comparison highlights strengths, growth gaps, and potential risk areas, creating a “mirror effect” where students see themselves in context.
### - Targeted Gap Identification
When misalignment is detected, the system flags high-impact weaknesses, identifies behavioural bottlenecks, and suggests small, actionable development challenges. The goal is not to discourage ambition but to make growth measurable and focused
