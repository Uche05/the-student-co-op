With 3 days left, you’re in the "High-Intensity" phase. You need to stop theorizing and start building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). A hackathon judge doesn't want to see a 100% finished app; they want to see a functioning core and a compelling story.

Here is your 3-day checklist to get the "Student Co-op" from idea to demo.

Day 1: The Foundation (Core Logic & Database)
Fix your Environment: Spend the first hour nuking your broken .venv and rebuilding it (as discussed).

Database Setup: Create your Firebase project and get your serviceAccountKey.json.

Scoring Logic: Write the Python function in Flask that takes dummy survey answers (e.g., [1, 5, 3]) and calculates a "Gap Score."

Example: If user wants to be a Developer but scores 1/5 on "Logic Questions," flag a 40% awareness gap.

The "Save" Test: Successfully push one dummy score from Flask to Firestore.

Goal for Day 1: You can run a script that sends data to the cloud.

Day 2: The Experience (Frontend & Auth)
The Form: Build a simple HTML page with your psychometric questions. Don't worry about CSS yet; use a framework like Bootstrap to make it look "okay" instantly.

User Onboarding: Set up a basic Login/Signup page using Firebase Auth.

The Dashboard: Build the "Awareness Profile" page. This is where you pull the student's specific scores from Firestore and show them. *

Logic Check: Ensure that when User A logs in, they cannot see User B's scores (testing your "Owner-Only" rules).

Goal for Day 2: A user can log in, take a test, and see their results on a dashboard.

Day 3: The Pitch (Polish & Presentation)
UI Polish: Add your logo, fix the colors, and ensure the loading page isn't just a white screen.

The "Awareness" Hook: Add 2–3 "Actionable Tips" to the dashboard (e.g., "Since you're a shy Politics student, here is a local debating club link"). Judges love this "solution" part.

The Slide Deck: Create a 3-minute pitch.

The Problem: Students are "blind" to soft-skill gaps.

The Demo: Show the app live (or a screen recording if the Wi-Fi is shaky).

The Tech: Mention Flask + Firebase for security and scalability.

The "Bang" Ending: End with: "We don't just show students who they are; we show them who they need to become."

Goal for Day 3: A bug-free demo and a rehearsed 3-minute pitch.

Integration Cheat Sheet (What to remember)
Safety First: Keep your .env and json keys out of your public code.

Mock Data: If you can't get the psychometric logic 100% perfect, use "Mock Data" for the demo to show what the final version would look like.

Mobile View: Many judges check apps on their phones. Since you're using Flask, make sure your HTML is "Responsive" (Bootstrap handles this automatically).
